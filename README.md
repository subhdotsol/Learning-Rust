# 🦀 Rust Learning Journey

This repository is a personal documentation of my journey learning the Rust programming language.
It uses a **multi-binary project setup**, where each file is an independent executable demonstrating a specific Rust concept.

---
Each file in the `src/bin/` directory is a standalone example or mini project, focusing on a specific Rust concept.

## Final Words

Feel free to fork it, play with the code, break things, and learn by doing.  
Rust has a learning curve — but it's worth every step.

🎯 **Happy learning Rust!**  
Stay curious, stay consistent, and don’t forget to `cargo build` your confidence one concept at a time. 🦀🚀
